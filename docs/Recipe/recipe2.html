<h3><b>Next, carefully follow these steps.</b></h3>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Unpackage all the chocolate Bars and all the twizlers.</li>
		<li>Create a flatbed of twizlers the size of one chocolate bar and place a chocolate bar onto each group of twizlers.</li>
		<li>Any remaining twizlers should be placed in rows on top of the chocolate bars.</li>
		<li>The entire mixture should be placed on a pan and in the oven at 350<sup>0</sup></li>
		<li>Put on your white vans.</li>
		<li>Go outside.</li>
				<ul><li>Quickly, find the nearest person and proclaim to them you have an important message. If they show interest, proceed. If no interest is shown, move on to another person until someone shows interest.</li></ul>
		<li>Recite these exact words to whoever has shown interest.</li>
			<ul><li>"My name ain't Stan or Dan or Graham but I wear vans. Yeah, my name is Jay and I wear them every day!</li></ul>
		<li>Quickly pull the vans off your feet and smell-test them. Regardless of whether or not they smell like a dumpster raise them in the air and spin around like Mario before getting down on one knee and presenting them to the person you just spoke with.</li>
		<li>Go back inside.</li>
		<li>Take the chocolate-twizlers combination out of the oven and immediatly pour all the M&Ms on top.</li>
		<li>Put the chocolate-twizler-M&M combination in the freezer.</li>
