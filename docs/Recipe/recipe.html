	<h1>How to Make Chicken That Tastes Like Spinach</h1>
<h3><b>First, gather the following ingedients:</b></h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
		<li>2, 4 ounce balls of ground veal</li>
		<li>1 back scratcher</li>
		<li>6 ounces of mushroom stems</li>
		<li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
		<li>Salt</li>
		<li>Pepper</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<hr />
<h3><b>Next, carefully follow these steps.</b></h3>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Drink the H<sub>2</sub>O. Always remember to stay hydrated!</li>
		<li>Split one of your 4 ounce balls of ground veal in half and create two smaller balls.</li>
		<li>Take one of the newly created smaller balls and place it on a dark, nonstick cooking pan and place it over high heat.</li>
		<li>The other newly created, smaller ball should be thrown in the face of your nearest kitchen companion. If there isn't anybody nearby, throw it in the air and try to catch the ball in your mouth.</li>
		<li>The other 4 ounce ball of ground veal should be placed in a plastic bag and left in the freezer.</li>
		<li>All 6 ounces of mushroom stems should be sautéed in the extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper on low heat.</li>
				<ul><li>Use 267 grains of salt and 143 grains of pepper per mushroom stem.</li></ul>
		<li>Scratch your back.</li>
		<li>Give the sautéing mushrooms a firm little shake that really reminds them who the conscious, moral, intelligent, self-governing and aware organism in the relationship is.</li>
		<li>Spread the mushroom stems over the half-ball of veal which has been sufficiently burnt; seeing as you negligently left it on high heat this entire time.</li>
		<li>Pull the frozen veal out of the freezer and chuck it out the window (extra points if the window is closed when you do this.)</li>
		<li>Remove the veal-mushroom combination from the pan and let cool for 2-3 minutes.</li>
		<li>Throw everything out and go to <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com">McDonald's</a>.</li>
	</ol>
